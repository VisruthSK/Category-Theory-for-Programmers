# [Category Theory for Programmers](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/)
I'm reading the PDF version found [here](https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf/).

I wrote very briefly about CTFP on my [website](https://www.visruth.com/favorites/) and will speak at greater length here.

I'm interested in functional programming, and in discussions I read online I often see ideas bandied about that I don't understand; infamously, "a monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors, what's the problem?" - ['Phillip Wadler'](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3870088/a-monad-is-just-a-monoid-in-the-category-of-endofunctors-whats-the-problem/3870310#3870310) I want to learn more about these ideas, and somehow stumbled upon this book. I absolutely love it! Milewski writes quite cogently, and he has demystified many concepts. I'm approaching this from an amateur mathematician and curious programmer's perspective, and I feel like I can grasp most everything Milewski writes about. It is dense at times, but it is always clear. 

There are portions of the text which contrast C++ and Haskell, and I'm mostly skipping those. The book comes with exercises, which I'm mostly doing. I'm writing solutions in R and using S7 whenever classes are needed (often.) I'm skipping some exercises that can't really be implemented cleanly in R.

I like to take notes when reading. These are very rough notes, mostly for future me. I will sometimes copy things wholesale from the book; those are quoted in my notes.
